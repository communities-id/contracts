## About Us

Communities ID is the first Decentralized Identity as a Service protocol. We provide a “Username.Brandname” style exclusive yet open DID system for promising crypto projects.

💎 Why Communities ID?

🔹Free Brand DID Reservation and Minting: We are currently in the private launch phase and extending an exclusive invitation to select projects like yours. During this phase, brand DID reservation and minting come at no cost.

🔹Build a Strong Community with Unified Identity: a chance to enrich your project by creating a robust community with a unified identity across multiple chains.

🔹Customized Price Models: We offer support for customized price models to align with your specific community management needs.

🔹Simple SDK Integration: Our optional SDK integration is straightforward, requiring just 1 hour of workload. This allows your community to seamlessly mint their IDs on your website/platform.
